        Only the goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only
        within the penalty area surrounding the goal.Football, known as soccer in some parts of the world, is the most popular sport globally. Played by two teams of eleven
        players on a rectangular field with a goal at each end, the objective is simple: score by getting the ball into the
        opponent’s net. Despite the simplicity, football is rich in strategy, skill, and teamwork.
        
        The sport has a long history, with its modern form taking shape in the 19th century in England. Today, it transcends
        cultures, languages, and borders, uniting millions in passion. From local matches on dusty fields to grand events like
        the FIFA World Cup, football creates moments of joy, tension, and collective celebration.

        Key elements include dribbling, passing, and shooting, requiring technical ability and sharp decision-making. Football
        is as much about individual brilliance—like Messi’s dazzling runs or Ronaldo’s powerful shots—as it is about teamwork
        and coordination. Defenders, midfielders, and forwards all have distinct roles, contributing to the flow of the game.
        
        Off the pitch, football is a powerful cultural force. It fosters community and national pride, while also breaking
        barriers. Whether it's street games or stadium clashes, football brings people together, offering a universal language
        of competition and camaraderie.
